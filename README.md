# Name letter Counter

This Python program takes user input for a name and calculates the count of each individual letter in the name. The program prompts the user to input their name and then displays the count of each letter present in the name.

# How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter their name.
2. It calculates the count of each letter (case-insensitive) in the name.
3. The program displays the count of each letter in the format: <letter>: <count>.
4. For example, if the input name is "Muhammad Arif," the program will output:

This allows you to see how many times each letter occurs in the provided name.
